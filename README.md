# Tetris game on python

Tetris is a classic puzzle video game that was originally created and designed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. The game involves manipulating a set of falling shapes, known as tetrominoes, which are made up of four blocks each, in order to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps.

Players must move and rotate the tetrominoes as they fall from the top of the playing field to the bottom, in order to fit them into the available space and create complete lines. As players progress through the game, the tetrominoes fall faster and the difficulty increases, making it more challenging to create complete lines.

If players are unable to fit the falling tetrominoes into the available space, they will accumulate at the bottom of the playing field, eventually reaching the top and causing the game to end. The goal is to score as many points as possible by creating complete lines and clearing them from the playing field.

Tetris has been released on a wide range of platforms over the years, and has become one of the most popular and recognizable video games of all time, with a simple yet addictive gameplay that has stood the test of time.
